# Learn Git & Github
## Mentor : Huda Bikhoir

### GitHub is a project management, code versioning system, as well as a social networking platform for developers around the world. There are so many functions that can be used by developers, so that through this platform it is easier for developers to develop a work.

### Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

### See gittutorial to get started, then see giteveryday for a useful minimum set of commands. The Git Userâ€™s Manual has a more in-depth introduction.

### After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about individual Git commands with "git help command". gitcli manual page gives you an overview of the command-line command syntax.

### 1). Git Add => Add file contents to the index
### 2). Git Init => Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
### 3). Git Branch => List, create, or delete branches
### 4). Git Commit => Record changes to the repository
### 5). Git Push => Update remote refs along with associated objects
### 6). Git Pull => Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
